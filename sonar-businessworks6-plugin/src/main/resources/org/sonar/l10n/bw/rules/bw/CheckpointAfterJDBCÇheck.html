<p>This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. 
    Do not place checkpoint after or in a parallel flow of Query activities or idempotent activities. 
    Database operations such as Update, Insert and Delete are considered non-idempotent operations. 
    You should always place a checkpoint immediately after any database insert or update activity to persist the response. 
    However, for queries, there is no need to place checkpoints</p>
