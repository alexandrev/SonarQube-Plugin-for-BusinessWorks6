<p>This rule checks the placement of a Checkpoint activity within a process. When placing your checkpoint in a process, be careful with certain types of process starters or incoming events, so that a recovered process instance does not attempt to access resources that no longer exist. For example, consider a process with an HTTP process starter that takes a checkpoint after receiving a request but before sending a response. In this case, when the engine restarts after a crash, the recovered process instance cannot respond to the request since the HTTP socket is already closed. As a best practice, do not place Checkpoint activity right after or in parallel path to HTTP activities.</p>
