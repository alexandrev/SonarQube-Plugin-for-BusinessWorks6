<P>EMPTY activity should be used if you want to join multiple transition flows. For example, there are multiple transitions out of an activity and each transition takes a different path in the process. In this scenario you can create a transition from the activity at the end of each path to an Empty activity to resume a single flow of execution in the process. This rule checks whether multiple transitions from an activity in a parallel flow merge into EMPTY activity</P>
